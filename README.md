# üé¨ FlickFinder

FlickFinder is a movie discovery web application that allows users to search for films, browse top-rated titles, and explore what‚Äôs currently in theaters or coming soon. Built as a modern single-page application using React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and the TMDb API, FlickFinder offers a smooth, responsive user experience for film lovers.

## Responsible Use of AI
#### I used AI to help me:
* Understand how to structure my React components using props and useState
* Debug fetch requests to the TMDb API and handle edge cases
* Learn how to correctly implement createAsyncThunk with Redux Toolkit
#### Throughout the project, I made sure to learn from the AI guidance and review the code I implemented to understand how it works, rather than copying without context.

## Stretch Goals
#### If I had more time to continue building out FlickFinder, I would expand its features to include:
‚úµ User Authentication
* Add login and signup functionality to allow users to create an account, log in, and access a personalized dashboard.

‚úµ Cast Section on Movie Details
* Display a list of cast members with their names, character roles, and profile images from the TMDb API.

‚úµ "Save to Favorites" Feature
* Let users save movies they love to a personal favorites list for later viewing.

‚úµ Dedicated Component Pages with Recommendations
* Move each movie category (e.g., Popular, Now Playing) to its own route and page. At the bottom of each page, include a related movie recommendation that the user can add to their list.

#### These stretch goals would make FlickFinder a more personalized, interactive, and immersive experience for movie enthusiasts.
